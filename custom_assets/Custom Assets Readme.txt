- If you use custom textures, models, etc., they go in here if you want them synced to the other devs.
- So you'll end up putting a COPY of your custom assets into this folder that don't get used during run-time, specifically for syncing to the other devs.
- Organize them into this folder as if it was a regular mounted folder. (Placeholder "models" and "materials" folders exist to help get your bearings.)

NOTE: Alternatively you could host an MP server to share the assets and I'll help get them into the repo.
